Welcome to the ScoutRED API. This API exposes a way to lookup property data on a per parcel basis including various layers the parcel intersects with.

ScoutRED uses JSON format for data transmission. All POST requests expect incoming data to be in JSON format. All responses from the API will also be in JSON format.

These docs are still a work in progress and therefore data contracts may change. We will do our best to warn all API consumers prior to data contract changes. Once we have reached a solid v1 of the API we will freeze the data contracts and only make changes to future versions of the API.
